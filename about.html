		<p> Queen's U Gamers is a club at Queen's that aims to create a community for those who enjoy playing online video games. Three years ago the club was founded where a small group of gamers met up in Goodwin every two weeks to play and share games. Since then, we have grown to over 50 members, where we hold weekly gaming sessions and various tournaments and events with rewards and food. Our events are also a great place to stop by and hangout. Most who attend our weekly events spend more time socializing then they do gaming. We hope in the future to be able to take trips to other universities and compete in competitions. </p>
